## Step 5.

Do the exercise that the coaches gave and place the files you created inside the folder.

## Step 6.

Finaly add all the files to git, commit with a message and push them.

```
git add .
git commit -m "note of what you changed in the files"
git push origin master
```

### Understanding git

Want to learn what git does?

Follow this tutorial:
<https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-git/modules/learn-git-git-workflow-u>

<details>
<summary>In case you already used the free codecademy PRO trial (click arrow)</summary>

### step 1

Create a folder with terminal or with an interface.
Cd into that folder you just made with terminal and follow the next step.

### step 2

![](https://i.imgur.com/Jr1cdlz.png)

### step 3

We need some files inside this folder.

You can use `echo "GIT exercise" > readme.md`

### step 4

Now that we made the folder and files we can check our current status.

Checking current folder status

![](https://i.imgur.com/CEL6LGB.png)

Codecademy uses 2 files init_test.rb and scene-1.txt If you followed the previous step you should only see readme.md

### step 5

Git now needs to know what to stage, we will use `git add` for this.

For this exercise we will add our readme.md file.

![](https://i.imgur.com/Rv6P6NP.png)

### step 6 (How git works)

![](https://i.imgur.com/L4N4f2X.png)

### step 7

Git can be used in the terminal to see the changes in files after you added them with `git add`.

The command you can use to see the changes made is `git diff (filename)`.

![](https://i.imgur.com/ZQ6m2ii.png)

In this example you can see I echoed a new text inside of the readme.md file.

Dont forget to run `git add` after you changed the file.

### step 8

Now we can commit to the repository.

![](https://i.imgur.com/bWJ1ds3.png)

The command we use for commit is `git commit`

Commiting the files you added is building a history for the file, to make searching for changes easier you should add a message (-m).

And in the terminal you cannot use spaces so thats why we will enclose our message(-m) with quotes "just like this".

### step 9

Now we can finaly check if we done all the work correctly.

We will use `git log` for this.

> In the output, notice:
>
> - A 40-character code, called a SHA, that uniquely identifies the commit. This appears in orange text.
>
> - The commit author (you!)
>
> - The date and time of the commit
>
> - The commit message

### with all these commands you should understand the basics of how git works

<details>
<summary>Link new pc to GitHub</summary>

### First time linking a pc to GitHub

<details>

### The first job is to authenticate your machine in github

<summary>Show me how to link</summary>
You can do this by storing your credentials or creating an SSH key.

#### We will create an SSH key as it is far more secure.

Creating an SSH key depends on the machine (OS) you use.

<details>
<summary>LINUX</summary>
Generate SSH-key (Linux)

1. Open your terminal
2. Copy the following command into your terminal
   Change "your_email@example.com" to the email address linked to your Github account and press `Enter`.

   ```shell
   ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com"
   ```

   This will create an SSH key that is linked to your email

3. Generate a private/public RSA key pair
   When you are asked to "Enter a file in which to save the key", press `Enter`. This will accept the standard location.

4. Enter a file in which to save the key (/home/_user_name_/.ssh/id_rsa): [Leave blank and press `Enter`]
5. Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase): [Leave blank and press `Enter`]
6. Enter same passphrase again: [Leave blank and press `Enter`]

</details>

<details>
<summary>MAC</summary>
Use Github on the terminal (for Mac)

To login into github you need a SSH-key. In the next steps we will see how to generate one and link it to your github account.
Generate a SSH-key (for Mac)

1. Open your terminal
2. Copy the following command into your terminal
   Change "your_email@example.com" to the email address linked to your Github account and press `Enter`.

   ```shell
   ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com"
   ```

   This will create an SSH key that is linked to your email

3. Generate a private/public RSA key pair
   When you are asked to "Enter a file in which to save the key", press `Enter`. This will accept the standard location.

4. Enter a file in which to save the key (/Users/_user_name_/.ssh/id_rsa): [Leave blank and press `Enter`]
5. Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase): [Leave blank and press `Enter`]
6. Enter same passphrase again: [Leave blank and press `Enter`]

</details>

<details>
<summary>WINDOWS</summary>
Use GitHub on the terminal (for Windows)

To login into github you need a SSH-key. In the next steps we will see how to generate one and link it to your github account.
Generate a SSH-key (for Windows)

1. Open you Terminal/cmd.
2. Copy the following command into your terminal
   Change "your_email@example.com" to the email address linked to your Github account and press `Enter`.

   ```shell
   ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com"
   ```

   This will create an SSH key that is linked to your email

3. Generate a private/public RSA key pair
   When you are asked to "Enter a file in which to save the key", press `Enter`. This will accept the standard location.

4. Enter a file in which to save the key (/c/Users/_user_name_/.ssh/id_rsa): [Leave blank and press `Enter`]
5. Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase): [Leave blank and press `Enter`]
6. Enter same passphrase again: [Leave blank and press `Enter`]

</details>

#### Now that we created our SSH-key we can put it in GitHub

First we will copy our SSH-key

- Linux
  `xclip -sel clip < ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub`

- Mac
  `pbcopy < ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub`

- Windows
  `clip < ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub`

Now that our SSH-key is copied we will paste it in GitHub.

After you followed the above steps in the image you click "New SSH key".

Then you name your key eg. "pc becode" and paste your key in the second window

Finaly click Add key

### Now your machine is known in GitHub

<details>
<summary>Testing time!</summary>
Ofcourse we want to know how to ```git push``` something to Github.

First of all we create a folder `mkdir newfolder` and we go to it in the terminal `cd newfolder`

Then we go to the github website.

And we add a new repository to our profile.

![](https://i.imgur.com/uGzzeVA.png)

Finaly we copy and paste all the commands as shown below in the image.
![](https://i.imgur.com/aedRrmu.png)

#### If you entered all the commands correctly (and you will have entered the last command push) you will not be asked to log in with your credentials.

<summary>How to clone a repository</summary>
1. Create a directory on the local file system.
2. Create a repo on Github.
3. Select Clone "Clone or download" on Github, copy the link

4. In Visual Studio Code, sect File -> Add Folder to Workspace ->Select the newly created directory
5. Select Terminal Window
   In the window, type:

```
git config --global user.name <github userID>

git clone <URL from github link copied earlier>
```

## Problems

_"I still need to log in???!!? SSH NOT WORKING"_

_"I got an error and github isnt linked"_

*"I got no errors what so ever and github isnt *updated*"*

#### Step 1: READ THE ERROR

Most of the time the errors can be solved by logical thinking without having previous knowledge.

<details>
<summary>"I still need to log in???!!? SSH NOT WORKING"</summary>

First

`git remote -v`

If any of your remotes are starting with **https** you are **NOT** using your SSH-key

To fix this:

`git remote rm origin`

Re-add the remote location you have added before from github.

`git remote add origin new_link_from_github`

#### Step 2: Google

While some other people know the solution, you will learn what your mistake was by googling and finding a solution.

#### Step 3: In case of no Google results

Ask someone who knows the solution (eg the coaches)
